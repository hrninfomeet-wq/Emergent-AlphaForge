# AlphaForge Trading Lab — Updated plan.md

## Objectives (Updated)
- Build a local-first and cloud-ready **React + FastAPI + MongoDB** trading lab for Indian indices (**NIFTY 50, BANKNIFTY, SENSEX**).
- Prove the full quant workflow end-to-end:
  - ingest candles → store locally → indicators → strategy plugins → backtest → walk-forward IS/OOS → robust metrics + equity/drawdown
- Provide a modular **Python strategy plugin system** usable for **backtest / optimize / live**.
- Provide a **one-click Auto-Optimizer** (Bayesian + Grid + Genetic) that automatically tunes parameters and measures robustness.
- Provide disciplined live options BUY recommendations (Upstox WS) with full **audit trail**, **configurable pre-trade checklist**, and **paper trading**.
- Ensure the entire stack can be run locally on a PC via **Docker Compose**, with complete handover documentation for a new AI agent.

## Context, Credit, And Agent Usage Policy

This project should be developed in small verified slices so long chats and unnecessary model usage do not waste credits.

### When to compact or fork the chat
- Compact/export/fork at natural checkpoints: after a feature is verified, after docs are updated, before starting a major new subsystem, or when the chat becomes too long for quick reasoning.
- Do not fork in the middle of broker auth, database mutation, live-stream debugging, or a half-finished code edit.
- The new chat should treat the repository and docs as the source of truth, not the old conversation history.
- Start a new chat by reading, in order:
  1. `docs/HANDOFF.md`
  2. `plan.md`
  3. `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`
  4. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  5. The relevant code/tests for the next planned task

### Credit-efficient execution rules
- Always inspect what is already implemented before changing code.
- Use local project docs, tests, and code first; browse only for current broker/API behavior, changed exchange rules, or other time-sensitive facts.
- Use low/minimal reasoning for status checks, file search, docs edits, formatting, and repeated verification.
- Use medium reasoning for normal backend/frontend implementation where the expected behavior is already clear.
- Use high reasoning only for trading-critical design: broker WebSocket behavior, data integrity, option expiry resolution, order lifecycle, risk controls, strategy correctness, and architecture decisions.
- Prefer targeted tests during development, then run the full backend test suite, frontend build, API smoke test, and browser check at the end of each feature slice.

### Subagent / specialist usage
- Use subagents only for independent workstreams: code review, frontend visual QA, backend API review, docs audit, or isolated strategy research.
- Do not use subagents for credential handling, tightly coupled edits in the same files, database clearing, live broker account actions, or destructive operations.
- Each subagent result must be reviewed before code changes are accepted into the main workspace.
- Keep handoff notes short and current so a new model can resume from files instead of reading a long chat.

## Phase 4 — Upstox Live + Paper + Audit Trail + Options Backtest (BIGGEST)
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL PHASE 4 SCAFFOLD (OAuth, REST historical ingest, read-only WebSocket tick stream foundation, option data workflows, offline signal lifecycle, paper-trading foundation, and Strategy Deployment management present; deployment evaluator not complete)

### User stories
1. As a user, I can complete Upstox OAuth and start WS tick streaming.
2. As a user, I see live options BUY signals (CE/PE) with suggested strike and full context.
3. As a user, I can configure the pre-trade checklist (profiles + thresholds) and see why signals were blocked.
4. As a user, I can one-click **Deploy to Paper** and track live P&L.
5. As a user, every signal is logged with a full snapshot for later audit.
6. As a user, I can backtest **weekly expiry options** (paired INDEX+OPTION legs) using real option candles.
7. As a user, I can create a forward-test Strategy Deployment only from a saved preset or saved backtest result.

### Implementation steps (revised)
- **Upstox OAuth**
  - ✅ Endpoints exist:
    - `/api/upstox/auth/start` (redirect)
    - `/api/upstox/auth/callback` (exchange code → encrypted token storage)
  - ⚠️ Needs real-credential validation and refresh/reconnect hardening.
- **Upstox REST historical ingest**
  - ✅ 1m index candle ingest scaffold exists and writes to the same warehouse.
  - ⚠️ Needs credential validation, rate-limit testing, and data-quality checks.
- **Upstox WS (tick stream)**
  - ✅ Initial read-only V3 market-data stream implemented.
  - ✅ Start/stop/status/latest-ticks APIs exist.
  - ✅ Uses Upstox V3 authorized WebSocket URL, binary JSON subscription message, protobuf tick decoding, reconnect/backoff, and sanitized `ticks` persistence.
  - ✅ Market Header prefers fresh ticks and falls back to REST/API sources when ticks are stale or unavailable.
  - ⏳ Needs multi-session live hardening and latency/reconnect observation.
  - ⏳ Dynamic ATM±5 options universe subscription is still pending.
- **Options universe + contracts**
  - Daily/weekly expiries selection and strike selection.
  - Store instruments/contract metadata (new: `contracts`).
  - Option Data Planner is the selected-moneyness trust gate. Default planning is ATM only; OTM/ITM selections are explicit.
  - Raw Option Universe Audit is a broad warehouse diagnostic and may show missing contracts that were never selected by the planner.
- **Signal lifecycle state machine (persistent)**
  - ✅ Offline foundation exists: WATCHING → FORMING → CONFIRMED → TRIGGERED → ACTIVE → EXITED → AUDITED.
  - ✅ Stores signal transition history in `signals`.
  - ⏳ Needs Strategy Deployment evaluator to create signals from strategy output rather than manual research input.
- **Paper trading engine**
  - ✅ Manual deploy-to-paper foundation exists.
  - ✅ Persist paper trades, mark outcomes, close trades, and auto-close on stored stop/target.
  - ⏳ Needs live tick/stored replay marks, trailing exits, and daily risk controls.
- **Strategy Deployments**
  - ✅ Design documented in `docs/STRATEGY_DEPLOYMENTS.md`.
  - ✅ Backend model/routes persist deployments in `strategy_deployments`.
  - ✅ Live Signals panel creates deployments from saved presets or saved backtest results.
  - ✅ Pause/resume/archive status controls exist.
  - First confirmation mode: completed `1m_close`.
  - Per-tick evaluation is a later manual switch after the strategy is trusted.
  - Every signal requires manual approval before paper deployment or recommendation action.
  - Default option moneyness: ATM; configurable: ATM, OTM1, ITM1.
  - Blocked signals must be recorded and identifiable.
  - Prefer fewer cleaner signals over every weak setup.
  - ⏳ Needs evaluator to produce clean/blocked signals from completed 1-minute candles.
- **OPTIONS BACKTEST (port semantics from reference Node repo)**
  - Use real expired-option candles via Upstox V3 expired-instruments API.
  - Paired INDEX + OPTION legs.
  - Two risk modes:
    - `spot_points` (INDEX_ONLY exit)
    - `option_premium_pct` (OPTION_ONLY exit)
  - Store options candles in Mongo (new: `options_1m`).
- **Frontend**
  - ✅ Live Signals placeholder replaced with offline lifecycle console.
  - ✅ Paper Trading placeholder replaced with paper journal and risk badges.
  - ✅ Strategy Deployment management UI added to Live Signals.
  - ⏳ Wire Live Signals to deployment evaluator and, later, WebSocket ticks.
  - ⏳ Add paper replay UI.
- **Testing**
  - Run `testing_agent_v3` end-to-end.

### Reference (must read before implementing)
User’s legacy repo: https://github.com/hrninfomeet-wq/project-deepseek-version
- `server/research/pluginHistoricalBacktest.js`
- `server/paper/paperBroker.js`
- `server/live/liveSession.js`
- `server/upstox/oauth.js`, `server/upstox/websocket.js`

### Success criteria
- Stable WS streaming (no REST hammering).
- Live signals auditable + replayable.
- Strategy Deployments are auditable back to saved preset/backtest result and frozen params.
- First forward testing runs on completed 1-minute candles and requires manual approval.
- Options backtest matches the paired-leg semantics from legacy repo.

## Phase 5 — Profitability Boosters (Probability Engine + Meta-model)
**Status:** ⏳ NOT STARTED

### User stories
1. Each signal shows **time-bound probabilities** for targets/stops.
2. Targets/stops adapt to **VIX + DTE + regime**.
3. “What-if” P&L reports for taking all vs filtered signals.
4. Adaptive quality scoring by strategy+regime.
5. Optional Telegram alerts.

### Implementation steps (revised)
- **Probability engine (Kaplan–Meier survival analysis)**
  - Requires ≥6 months of signal history.
  - Similarity filters: instrument, regime, VIX bucket, DTE, time-of-day, setup signature.
- **Meta-model**
  - Learn which strategies to enable per regime (logistic regression / LightGBM).
- **Position sizing**
  - Kelly fraction + equity-curve learning + daily loss cutoff.
- **Event calendar filter**
  - RBI/FOMC/CPI auto-block window.
- **India VIX overlay**
  - Adjust target/stop multiples by VIX percentile.
- Run `testing_agent_v3`.

### Success criteria
- Probabilities computed from sufficient historical samples (transparent warnings when sample is insufficient).
- Signal EV/robustness visible.

---

## Phase 6 — Swing/Positional Extension
**Status:** ⏳ NOT STARTED

### User stories
1. Backtest swing strategies on **1H/1D** with gap handling.
2. Positions span days with multi-day lifecycle.
3. Swing-specific strategies selectable and optimizable.
4. Warehouse stores daily candles with integrity.
5. Swing results include regime segmentation.

### Implementation steps
- Add higher TF ingestion/resampling + swing risk/exit models.
- Add swing plugins + walk-forward tuned for longer windows.
- Run `testing_agent_v3`.

### Success criteria
- Swing runs reproducible; gaps handled; audit trail intact.

**Status:** ⏳ LOCAL CHANGES PENDING PUSH

### Goal
Push the local repair/bootstrap changes back to the user’s GitHub repo when the user is ready.

### Implementation steps
1. Review `git diff`.
2. Commit with a message such as `Repair local bootstrap and update handoff status`.
3. Push to `hrninfomeet-wq/Emergent-AlphaForge`.

### Success criteria
- Repo contains:
  - backend + frontend + docs + docker-compose + scripts
  - tags or releases (optional)
  - README visible and correct
